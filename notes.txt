- Removing All meshes resulted in success.
    - Renderer mesh is now magenta, even though scene with many meshes but no materials had them grey
    - Is it possible that some "option" stays stuck between meshes?
- Strangely, It may have been the removing of materials that fixed it.
    - Resetting to previous file version, meshes are now amgenta, but correct shape.
