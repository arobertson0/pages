- Removing All meshes resulted in success.
    - Renderer mesh is now magenta, even though scene with many meshes but no materials had them grey
    - Is it possible that some "option" stays stuck between meshes?
- Strangely, It may have been the removing of materials that fixed it.
    - Resetting to previous file version, meshes are now amgenta, but correct shape.
- Having a single mesh with all materials in scene still breaks.
- One mesh one mat, still fucky
    - Maybe it's the `displacement` being connected to phantom data?
    - Setting displacement to 0 did not work
    - Removing displcement connection did not work
    - removing the displacement out did not work.
    - Manually setting normals input did not work
    - Renaming UV input did not work
    - Wrapping materials+scene in a mega-scope did not work
    - Manually connecting st1 did no work
    - Removing map transforms did not work
